##### Notes on Machine Learning 

From Coursera Lecture "What is Machine Learning"

Machine Learning is having a computer learn how to succeed in a task by watching experience and improving performance on a task based on that experience  

##### Supervised Learning v Unsupervised Learning  
Supervised: you teach the computer  
Unsupervised: Computer learns for itself  

##### Supervised Learning:
#### Regression v Classification
##### Regression problem
Example - have data, can use straight line or quadratic equation to calculate an expected result
  - an age of a person, a price of a house, a closing price of a stock 

##### Classification problem   
Example: 0 or 1 problem, need to choose between defined choices
  - a yes or no answer, a stock up or down 
    - may have two categories, may have more than two
    
    
    
##### Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
Can handle an infinite number of features (X variables?)
